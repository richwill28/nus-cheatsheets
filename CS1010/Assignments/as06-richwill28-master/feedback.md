This question is jointly graded by a bot and a tutor.

We found the binary executable for `add`.  It appears that your code compiles without errors.

The tutor has marked your code.  You can find [the comments from your tutor here](https://github.com/nus-cs1010-2021-s1/as06-richwill28/commit/9d69507867b288272fddf0c0c89d280eeaf3b73b).

Deduction by tutor: 0 (correctness), 0 (documentation), 0 (efficiency).

* No memory leaks detected. Note that your program might still leak memory in some situations.
* Your solution has a invalid memory read.  -1.  You should only read from memory locations you have access to.
* No invalid memory write detected.
* Your program crashes if memory allocation on the heap fails.  There is a -1 penalty for failing to guard against memory allocation failure.  Please remember to check for NULL.
* `clang` and `clang-tidy` are happy with your `add.c`.  No warnings are generated.  :confetti_ball:
* No documentation-related warnings are generated.
